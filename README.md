# EoYReview2022
Text analysis of my Daily Journaling effort. 

My attempt to learn programming with Python by analysing my Daily Journaling entries in 2022. I did manage to write 322 entries and did some analyses:<br>
1. Visualising Daily Rating
2. Word Count of Feelings
3. Cleaning Text from Stopwords (and trying Stemming using Sastrawi)
4. Clustering the days using k-means and Affinity Propagation
5. Word Cloud

The blogpost that explains more about this is here: <a href="https://lasasimi.com/?p=669&preview=true">2022 End of Year Review with Python</a>

I mainly study from this book titled "Text Analytics with Python: A Practitioner's Guide to Natural Language Processing" by Sarkar (2019) and browse codes from Kaggle and StackOverflow. 

Still a newbie on Python, so my codes can be more efficient of course. If you have any thoughts about this effort, how to improve this, or you are just interested in self-knowledge through data, feel free to hmu!
